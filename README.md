**Jobathon Insurance Analysis: Customer Value Strategies**

## Background Information

Jobathon, an insurance company serving nationwide, leverages extensive datasets in the insurance and finance sector. These datasets feature a unique label assigning a Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) score to clients who have purchased insurance, derived from various factors. This initiative underscores Jobathon's commitment to harnessing data-driven insights to enhance service delivery and customer satisfaction.

## Reflection

From the final results, we can see that neither regression nor machine learning modeling gave us very ideal outcomes. From the last K-means 3D scatter plot, we couldnâ€™t discern any useful insights.

The issue lies with the dataset. No matter how you look at it, this is not a very good dataset, and it lacks the information needed for CLV. However, this project is only meant to demonstrate my skills in regression and K-means, nothing more.

## Conclusion

With the current dataset, due to missing information, we are unable to deconstruct and deeply analyze CLV effectively. If given the opportunity later, I will seek out a higher quality insurance dataset to reanalyze.
